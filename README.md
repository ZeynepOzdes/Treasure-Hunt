# Treasure-Hunt
This is a basic university project on object-oriented programming and data structures.
This project has not finished yet.
It allows user to create a map with the size of their choice.
Obstacles, chests and character land in completely random places every time it runs.
Warning: Map and random placement controls are provided with a [150][150] matrix, therefore if the user enters a number higher than 1500, it will not run correctly.
